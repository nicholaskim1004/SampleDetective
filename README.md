## Sample Detective

As an avid hip-hop listener, sampling is an essential element to its music production. Often times, I find myself recalling bits of songs I've heard elsewhere and wonder, "Where have I heard this before?". That's what sparked the idea for this project. Is there a way to produce a product like Shazam that is able to locate sampled songs? Well we're in luck with the Sample Dectective!

In this repo I'll try to implement this algorithim on a handful of songs with the hopes of maybe making it a larger scale product.
